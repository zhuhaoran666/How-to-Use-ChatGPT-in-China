In the example above, ChatGPT can easily understand our requset and give us a reference answer.Most of the code in the answer can be run directly, a few may need to be modified to run. It can replace search engines in some ways.(Usually search engines contain a lot of useless information)
For some reason, the ChatGPT is not available in China. (include Hongkong,Macau and Taiwan) However they are ways to access it. Next I will provide a guide on how to use ChatGPT in china
### Step 1:Tool Preparation
Choose a Internet node that is not in China. If you already done, you can skip to Step2.<br>If you don't konw how to get a Internet node. I recommend a software here (<https://moetor.one>), it's not free but cheap. You registration and use will not bring me any benefits, I recommend it just because it useful. After you download and install, choose a node and go to the next step.
